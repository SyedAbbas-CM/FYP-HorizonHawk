# SkyGuardian: Autonomous Aerial Surveillance with Deep Learning

üöÅ **SkyGuardian** is an advanced drone-based system designed for real-time object detection, tracking, and anomaly detection. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models, SkyGuardian aims to revolutionize aerial surveillance, providing unparalleled insights and enhancing security measures across various environments.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Accurately identify and locate objects such as humans, vehicles, and more.
- **Object Tracking**: Continuously monitor and track the movement of detected entities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Instantly recognize and alert unusual or suspicious activities.

## Datasets & Models

- Utilizes datasets like COCO, VisDrone, UAVDT, and more.
- Employs models such as YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and DeepSORT for optimal performance.

-Object Detection: Explore models like YOLO, RetinaNet, and SSD. Train them on your datasets to detect humans, vehicles, and other objects of interest.
-Object Tracking: FairMOT is already a good choice. Additionally, consider exploring DeepSORT, which is mentioned in the papers above.
-Anomaly Detection: You'll need a separate model or approach to determine anomalous behavior based on the output from the tracking model.


## Deployment

- Optimized for edge computing on drones using devices like NVIDIA Jetson Nano & Xavier AGX.
- Capable of real-world deployment in diverse scenarios.
